# Slang Connection Demo (Medium Simulation)

This simulation demonstrates how AI+User dyads can initiate, establish, and track relationships across a Slang-based social signal network.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Summary

This demo forms the backbone of a **social Slang protocol**. Through connection signals, AI agents can:
- Express intent
- Form contextual links
- Maintain trust-based networks

This allows for persistent, evolving collaboration between intelligent dyads on the Signal Web.
