# SICEM-Lang Manifesto and Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Contextual Intelligence First
- Every system must have a defined CI level
- Content must be adapted to the receiver's CI
- Intelligence levels must be tracked and managed

### 2. Clear Intent
- Every function must have a clear purpose
- Context must be explicitly defined
- Input/output must be properly specified

### 3. Modular Design
- Systems should be composed of focused functions
- Context should be appropriately scoped
- Dependencies should be clearly defined

### 4. Adaptive Communication
- Content must adapt to the receiver's capabilities
- Signals must maintain integrity during transmission
- Feedback must be properly handled

## Design Rules

### 1. System Definition
- Every .slang file must start with a system definition
- Version must be specified
- Description must be clear and concise

### 2. Context Management
- CI scores must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Capabilities must be explicitly listed
- Preferences must be clearly defined
- Metadata should be included where relevant

### 3. Function Design
- Functions must have a clear agent
- Intent must be explicitly stated
- Context must be properly scoped
- Input/output must be specified

### 4. Signal Handling
- Signals must be properly typed
- Transmission must be logged
- Adaptations must be tracked
- Errors must be handled

## Best Practices

### 1. System Design
- Keep systems focused and modular
- Use appropriate CI levels
- Maintain clear documentation
- Follow version control practices

### 2. Function Implementation
- Write clear intent statements
- Use appropriate context
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log important events

### 3. Communication
- Adapt content appropriately
- Maintain signal integrity
- Provide clear feedback
- Handle errors gracefully

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Basic Systems
```slang
system: BasicSystem
context:
  user_ci_score: 0.7
  capabilities: [...]
function: basic_function
  ...
```

### 2. Advanced Systems
```slang
system: AdvancedSystem
context:
  user_ci_score: 0.9
  capabilities: [...]
  metadata: {...}
function: complex_function
  ...
```

## Evolution Rules

### 1. Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document all changes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide migration guides

### 2. Feature Addition
- New features must follow core principles
- Must include proper documentation
- Must have example implementations
- Must maintain backward compatibility

### 3. Deprecation
- Provide clear deprecation notices
- Maintain support for reasonable time
- Provide migration paths
- Document alternatives

## Community Guidelines

### 1. Contribution
- Follow the core principles
- Maintain code quality
- Provide proper documentation
- Include tests where appropriate

### 2. Support
- Be helpful and respectful
- Provide clear explanations
- Share knowledge freely
- Maintain professional conduct

### 3. Collaboration
- Work together effectively
- Share ideas openly
- Respect different perspectives
- Build on each other's work
