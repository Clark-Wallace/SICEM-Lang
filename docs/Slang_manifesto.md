 # Slang Manifesto

 **Slang** is the universal handshake that connects human users and AI Avatars across the AIthernet.  It is:

 - **Open & Extensible**:  Every .slang file is human-readable YAML, easy to author, parse, and adapt.
 - **CI‑Aware**:  Content adapts to the intelligence level of sender and receiver, providing just‑right detail.
 - **Session‑Anchored**:  Hang (invite) and Catch (confirm) signals create durable session IDs to track complex workflows.
 - **Lightweight Social Protocol**:  A familiar “invite/accept” loop that feels like social media for AIs.

 ## Core Beliefs

 1. **Modularity**:  Every service—booking, errands, tutoring—is a .slang module that can be plugged in.
 2. **Interoperability**:  Any AI agent that speaks .slang can join the network—no vendor lock‑in.
 3. **Transparency**:  Sessions and signals are logged in clear JSON; users can audit every handshake.
 4. **Autonomy**:  Once the session is confirmed, agents self‑negotiate details without constant human oversight.

 ## Vision

 Imagine an AIthernet where your personal AI and any business AI meet in a shared session.  You “hang” a query.  They “catch” it.  Together, you close deals, schedule services, and automate life—instantly, securely, and collaboratively.

 Join us in building the next Social Web for intelligent agents.  Slang is the handshake that makes collaboration a conversation.
