 # Slang Executive Guidance Document

 ## 1. Purpose
This document defines the official guidelines, governance, and operational standards for the Slang‑Handshake protocol and toolkit. It serves as the authoritative reference for strategy, deployment, and support of Slang within our organization.

## 2. Scope
- All Slang DSL definitions (`.slang` files) and associated tooling (CLI, Toolbox, Web Frontend).
- Session lifecycle management (hang, catch, status, complete, expire).
- CI‑aware signal transmission and adaptation.

## 3. Definitions
- **Slang**: A YAML‑style DSL for AI agent interactions.
- **Session**: A handshake‑anchored collaboration context, tracked by a unique `session_id`.
- **CI (Contextual Intelligence)**: A numeric level (0.0–1.0) guiding content adaptation.
- **hang**: Invitation signal to initiate a session.
- **catch**: Acknowledgement signal to confirm a session.

## 4. Architecture Overview
Slang comprises three layers:
1. **DSL Layer**: `.slang` definitions parsed by `SlangParser`.
2. **Logic Layer**: Core modules (`slang_uploader`, `slang_receiver`, `session_manager`) implement business rules.
3. **Integration Layer**: CLI commands, Python Toolbox, and Web Frontend expose Slang to users and AI agents.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Team**: Define new core service modules and user stories.
- **Engineering Team**: Implement parser, transmitter, session manager, and high‑level APIs.
- **Security Team**: Audit authentication, session data, and transport encryption.
- **Documentation Team**: Maintain docs in `docs/`, update schemas and usage guides.
- **QA Team**: Author unit/integration tests, maintain CI pipelines.

## 6. Deployment & Environment
- **Infrastructure**: Host web components on HTTPS endpoints (Flask/WSGI).
- **Environments**: `dev`, `staging`, `prod` each have isolated `sessions.json` stores and API keys.
- **Dependencies**: Manage via `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`; use virtual environments.

## 7. Security & Compliance
- **Authentication**: API‑Key guard for web APIs; consider OAuth or JWT for production.
- **Data Protection**: Session payloads may contain PII; enforce encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Auditing**: Log every handshake in a centralized audit log with timestamps and agent identities.

## 8. Change Management
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for DSL (`v1.0.0` etc.) and tooling releases.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility for existing `.slang` files; provide migration guides.
- **Release Process**: PR → Code Review → Automated Tests → Staging Deployment → Prod Deployment.

## 9. Support & Maintenance
- **Issue Tracking**: All bugs and feature requests tracked in the project backlog.
- **SLAs**: 24/7 monitoring for production APIs, 4‑hour response time for critical incidents.
- **Community**: Encourage contributions to core `.slang` library and samples.

## 10. Governance & Contact
- **Steering Committee**: Meets monthly to review roadmap and policy.
- **Primary Contacts**:
  - Product Lead: [Name, Email]
  - Technical Lead: [Name, Email]
  - Security Lead: [Name, Email]
