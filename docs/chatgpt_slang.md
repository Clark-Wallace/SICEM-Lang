# Slang-Handshake: A Session Handshake Protocol for AI-Avatar Collaboration

## Abstract

We present Slang-Handshake, a lightweight session-based protocol enabling AI Avatars and their human users to "hang" invitations and "catch" confirmations, creating anchor points for collaborative tasks across a decentralized AIthernet. Slang-Handshake abstracts social-media style meetups into a formal DSL (`.slang`) and API, letting any AI agent negotiate services (booking, errands, tutoring, etc.) seamlessly.

## 1. Introduction

As AI agents proliferate, users—each backed by their own AI Avatar—will need a standardized way to discover, invite, and negotiate with other AI agents (businesses, service providers, peer users). Drawing inspiration from social “hangouts,” Slang-Handshake defines two core signals:

- **hang**: an invitation, carrying session metadata and task payload
- **catch**: an acknowledgement, binding participants to a shared session

## 2. Functionality

- **Session Creation**: A “hang” file (or API call) generates a unique `session_id`, stores participants and task payload in a `session_manager`, and emits a `.slang` invite.
- **Session Confirmation**: A “catch” file (or API call) parses the `session_id`, marks it confirmed, and emits a `.slang` acknowledgement.
- **Session Lifecycle**: Sessions can be queried (`status`), completed, or expired; full metadata is persisted in `sessions.json`.
- **Adaptation & Transmission**: Using CI (Contextual Intelligence) levels, each AI adapts requests or responses via a `SignalTransmitter`, ensuring each side receives content at the right complexity and style.
- **Integration Paths**:
  - **CLI**: `slang-session` with subcommands `hang`, `catch`, `status`, `complete`, `expire`
  - **Toolbox API**: Python modules for programmatic use in any AI agent
  - **Web**: Flask frontend with API-key guard, HTML forms for `hang`/`catch`, JSON `status` endpoint

## 3. Why It’s Cool

- **Social-Media Analogy**: Users and AIs engage in familiar “invite” and “accept” flows—no copy-paste or manual negotiation required.
- **Decentralized & Extensible**: Any AI with an HTTP interface or CLI can join the AIthernet by speaking `.slang`.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: CI-aware signal adaptation tailors content to each agent’s capabilities, from basic commands to technical precision.
- **Session Anchors**: A shared `session_id` binds follow-on interactions (e.g. `book_hotel`, `check_availability`) under the same context.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built-in validator, unit tests, docs, and a pip-installable package make adoption trivial.

## 4. Architecture & How It Works

- **.slang DSL**: YAML-style files define system, context, and function blocks.
- **Parser & Interpreter**: `SlangParser` extracts definitions; `SlangInterpreter` and `SignalTransmitter` adapt and execute calls.
- **Session Manager**: `session_manager.py` persists sessions, supports `create`, `confirm`, `complete`, `expire`, `list`.
- **CLI Tools**: `slang-upload`, `slang-receive`, `slang-session`, `slang-validate`.
- **Toolbox API**: High-level wrappers (`upload_tool`, `download_tool`, `session_tool`) for embedding in any AI.
- **Web Frontend**: Flask app exposes `/hang`, `/catch`, `/status` with API-key protection and downloadable `.slang` files.

## 5. Example Scenarios

- **Yard Service**: Swai “hangs” a request to weed the yard under $75; YardServiceAI “catches” and schedules work.
- **Grocery Pickup**: Swai “hangs” a contactless order; GroceryAI “catches” and confirms delivery window.
- **Dog Walking**, **Tutoring**, **Car Maintenance**, and more—see `session_examples/`.

## 6. Next Steps

- **Core Service Library**: Define formal `.slang` templates for common services.
- **Authentication & Identity**: Sign and verify invites, map user/GPT IDs to credentials.
- **WebSocket Progress**: Stream real-time `SignalType.PROGRESS` updates for long-running jobs.
- **GUI Integration**: Embeddable React/Electron widget for session management.
- **Custom GPT Packaging**: Wrap handshake API as a Custom GPT using function-calling.

## 7. Conclusion

Slang-Handshake turns AI-Avatar collaboration into a social experience—invite, accept, then negotiate—all under a unified session anchor. Its modular design, CI-aware adaptation, and multiple integration paths position it as a foundational protocol for the evolving AIthernet.

### Appendix: ChatGPT Prompt to Brainstorm Improvements
```text
You are ChatGPT, an expert in AI agent protocols and DSL design. I have a project called Slang-Handshake, which defines a “hang”/“catch” session handshake DSL and API for AI agents to invite and confirm collaborative tasks. The key features are:
- .slang DSL for defining system, context, and function blocks
- hang/catch signals with session_id and payload metadata
- CI-aware signal adaptation via SignalTransmitter
- session_manager for create/confirm/complete/expire/list
- CLI tools (upload, receive, session, validate) and a Flask web frontend

Please suggest:
1. Potential security and authentication enhancements (API signing, OAuth, JWT).
2. UX improvements for embedding Slang-Handshake in chat interfaces or code editors.
3. Advanced session states or multi-party handshake flows.
4. Metrics and telemetry ideas to measure protocol effectiveness.
5. Any other innovations to make Slang-Handshake more robust, secure, and user-friendly.
