# TOOL: fault_tolerant_coordinator
# CATEGORY: ROBOTICS
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Fault tolerant coordinator manages complex coordination among a swarm of autonomous robots, enabling decentralized path optimization, formation control, and robust inter-robot communications for collective tasks.
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE:
#     # Prepare robot swarm identifiers and goals
#     robot_ids = ['bot1', 'bot2', 'bot3']
#     target_positions = [(10,5), (12,7), (8,3)]
#     plan = run(robot_ids, target_positions)
#     # Execute movement commands based on plan
#     for robot, command in plan.items():
#         send_command(robot, command)
#     log(f"Swarm plan executed successfully")

def run(*args, **kwargs):
    '''Stub function for fault_tolerant_coordinator tool'''
    return "This is a stub output for testing."

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# NEXT STEPS:
# 1. Define precise input and output specifications in the run() docstring.
# 2. Import required domain libraries (e.g., numpy, scipy, qiskit, biopython, etc.).
# 3. Implement the core algorithm per the DESCRIPTION header above.
# 4. Add error handling and validate all inputs.
# 5. Use the logger module to record key computation steps and metrics.
# 6. Create unit tests under tests/ to verify functionality and performance.
