def run(*args, **kwargs):
    '''Stub function for Object Detector tool'''
    return "This is a stub output for testing."

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# NEXT STEPS:
# 1. Define precise inputs/outputs in run() docstring.
# 2. Import and leverage appropriate libraries.
# 3. Implement core logic per DESCRIPTION.
# 4. Add error handling and validation.
# 5. Create unit tests under tests/.
